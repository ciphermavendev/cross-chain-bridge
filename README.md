Cross-Chain Token Bridge
A secure and efficient cross-chain token bridge implementation supporting Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon networks. This bridge enables users to transfer ERC20 tokens between different blockchain networks with multi-validator security and configurable parameters.
Features

Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon)
Multi-validator security mechanism
Configurable token limits and fees
Daily volume tracking and limits
Pausable functionality for emergency situations
Comprehensive testing suite
Gas-optimized operations
Support for both mainnet and testnet deployments

Architecture
The bridge operates using the following components:

Bridge Contract: Manages token locking and unlocking
Validator Contract: Handles transaction validation
Configuration System: Manages network and token parameters
Security Features: Implements various security measures

Prerequisites

Node.js >= 14.0.0
npm >= 6.14.0
Hardhat

Installation

Clone the repository:

bashCopygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/cross-chain-bridge.git
cd cross-chain-bridge

Install dependencies:

bashCopynpm install

Create environment file:

bashCopycp .env.example .env

Configure your environment variables in .env

Configuration

Network Configuration:

Edit config/networks.js for network-specific settings
Configure RPC endpoints and chain IDs


Token Configuration:

Edit config/constants.js for token-specific settings
Configure supported tokens and their parameters



Testing
Run the test suite:
bashCopy# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/TokenBridge.test.js

# Run coverage
npm run coverage
Deployment

Configure deployment network in hardhat.config.js
Set up environment variables in .env
Run deployment script:

bashCopy# Deploy to specific network
npm run deploy:ethereum
npm run deploy:bsc
npm run deploy:polygon

# Deploy to testnets
npm run deploy:goerli
npm run deploy:testnet
npm run deploy:mumbai
Security Measures

Multi-validator architecture
ReentrancyGuard implementation
Pausable functionality
Daily limits
Amount restrictions
Transaction verification

Usage Example
javascriptCopy// Lock tokens on source chain
await bridge.lockTokens(
    tokenAddress,
    amount,
    destinationChain,
    recipientAddress
);

// Unlock tokens on destination chain (validator only)
await bridge.unlockTokens(
    tokenAddress,
    recipientAddress,
    amount,
    sourceChain,
    transactionHash
);
Contract Verification
Verify deployed contracts:
bashCopy# Verify on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS constructor_argument_1

# Verify on BSCScan
npx hardhat verify --network bsc DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS constructor_argument_1
Monitoring & Maintenance

Monitor daily volumes:

javascriptCopyconst volume = await bridge.getDailyVolume(tokenAddress);

Check token configuration:

javascriptCopyconst config = await bridge.getTokenConfig(tokenAddress);
